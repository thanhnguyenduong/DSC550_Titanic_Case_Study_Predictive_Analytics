#### Project 1: Titanic Case Study 

This project was divided into 3 parts:  
Part 1: Graphics Analysis  
Part 2: Feature Reduction & Filling in Missing Values  
Part 3: Split Train Test & Model Selection and Evaluation  

The objective of this project was to get familiar with how a case study work and learning to perform data analysis from start to finish as well as creating a predictive model through training and testing the models. The model that I chose for this case study was logistic regression.



#### Project 2: Soccer Players Case Study  
Soccer has always been my favorite sport. Been playing soccer when I was young made me realize that dreams can be pursuit if you really put your heart into it. However, the one thing I do not understand was many soccer athletes are paid enormous amounts compared to others. There are in fact many factors that go into decisions as to why certain athletes are given particular contracts and at what time in their careers they receive these opportunities. This dataset for the case study contains data about Premier League soccer players including statistics about their league history and their market value from 2017-2018 season. We will explore if there are any trends in player history, country of origin, and popularity in applying this data
